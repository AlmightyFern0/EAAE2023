      <h2>The Topic</h2>
      <p>The Torino EAAE 2023 Annual Conference titled School of Architecture(s), will focus on the plurality
        of the discipline - not just architecture but architectures(s) - and the role of architectural education in
        training, questioning and practicing this plurality.</p>

      <p>Architecture as a discipline entangles multiple interactions between the physical world, technology
        and the organisation of the cultural and social environment of the profession, but its multidiciplinar
        character is not the only multidimension to be enquired . In the era of Postarchitecture moving
        towards an autonomous subjectivity, open up the field questioning the plurality of the discipline is
        crucial: not just architecture but architecture(s). Furthermore, European Schools for Architectural
        Education offer a wide variety of meanings of the term Architecture in their curricula. For all these
        reasons is urgent to discuss a broadening of the term itself to understand the positioning of
        Architectural education in the global contemporary world.</p>
      
      <p>The conference is an invitation to think differently, reflecting upon the context of the discipline to
        understand the knowledge of the future focusing on the question: what is Architecture in the age
        often described as post Architecture?</p>

      <p>Considering how antagonist characters polarise human knowledge and that architectural practice is
        moving towards an autonomous subjectivity, Architecture can be understood as dichotomies leading
        to a new paradigm beyond Postarchitecture: architecture(s). In this frame this conference attempts
        to reason around a contemporary broad and inclusive definition of Architecture through the
        discussion of six antinomian couple of concepts coupled into tree parallel sessions: Architecture as a <b><i>method</i></b>
        and/or as a <b><i>discipline</i></b>, Architecture of the <b><i>Masters</i></b> and/or of the <b><i>topics</i></b>, Architecture for
        <b><i>architects</i></b> and/or for the <b><i>community</i></b>, Architecture as <b><i>avant-garde</i></b> and/or <b><i>market-oriented</i></b>,
        Architecture <b><i>inside</i></b> and/or <b><i>outside</i></b> the wall, Architecture <b><i>disciplinary</i></b> and/or <b><i>extra-disciplinary</i></b>. The
        six dichotomies will be grouped into the tree main sessions: <b>Seeds of architecture</b>: Ways of Teaching,
        <b>Roots of Architecture</b>: Ways of Research, <b>Branches of Architecture</b>: Ways of Practice.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-text">
      <h2>Session1. Seeds of architecture: Ways of Teaching</h2>
      <p>Architecture as a <b><i>method</i></b> and/or as a <b><i>discipline</i></b>. Nowadays, there can be a shift in teaching
        architecture from defining a specific knowledge inside the discipline or a series of methods that can
        be generalised and exploited for the practice.</p>
      <p>Architecture of the <b><i>Masters</i></b> and/or of the <b><i>Topics</i></b>. Masters overlooked the teaching systems before
        the 20th; however, topics can be another point of view in validating the system of knowledge
        transmitted to future generations.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-text">
      <h2>Session 2. Roots of Architecture: Ways of Research</h2>
      <p>Architecture for <b><i>architects</i></b> and/or for the <b><i>community</i></b>. Who is the final architecture user, and how is
        this reflected in practice? Is Architecture a discipline or a service? Both points of view lead to a
        different definition of Architecture that needs to be translated into teaching.</p>
      <p>Architecture as <b><i>avant-garde</i></b> and/or <b><i>market-oriented</i></b>. What is the result? Architecture can be for the
        market, or architectural schools can open new visions that the market must look at.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-text">
      <h2>Session 3. Branches of Architecture: Ways of Practice</h2>
      <p>Architecture <b><i>inside</i></b> and/or <b><i>outside</i></b> the wall. Where is the place for the practice? Architecture can be
        inside the wall or outside of it; it can build the wall itself or be seen as a theoretical application.</p>
      <p>Architecture <b><i>disciplinary</i></b> and/or <b><i>extra-disciplinary</i></b>. What does architecture have to face?
        Architecture can look at itself in the realm of the discipline or look at other knowledge: sociology,
        economics, ethnography are just examples. Which are the potential of both approaches?</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-text">
      <h2>Submitting your contribution</h2>
      <p>In response to above suggested conference topics, we encourage you to submit your
        contribution and continue the discussion on the substance of architectural education.
        Abstracts can be submitted by teachers, researchers, practicing architects and PhD students
        not exclusively from EAAE member schools.</p>
      <p>Authors from other fields are invited to contribute to discussion as well.</p>
      <p>To contribute to our call, please use the form available below.</p>
      <p>The proposal should contain the title, names of authors, their brief cv, institutions or related
        offices, a 1500 characters abstract (including spaces) and one image 1600x1600 pixel in png
        or jpe format. The submissions will be blind-peer-reviewed by the conference scientific
        committee and reviewers and, upon acceptance and registration, invited for an oral
        presentation in one of the conference sessions.</p>
      <p class="highlight">The selected abstracts will be published online on TU delft&apos;s open access communication
        channel.</p>

    <section class="main-text">
      <h2>Conference presentation and publication rules</h2>
      <p>Accepted authors agree to either make a presentation, participate in thematic round table
        discussions or prepare their contribution in poster format at the School of architecture(s)
        Conference.</p>
      <p>Accepted authors must pay full conference registration to present at the conference and be
          eligible for inclusion in the proceedings and/or in the posters exhibition and online exhibit.</p>
      <p>The conference scientific commitee reserves the right to withhold a paper or a poster set
        from the program if the author has refused to comply with the guidelines.</p>
      <p>Failure to comply with the conference deadlines or request for materials in advance may
        result in an author being dropped from the program.</p>
      <p>To send the abstract, necessarily within 1500 characters including spaces, authors will have
        to access the <u>format</u> and fill in the fields relating to the authors, title, abstract, keywords,
        and a short CV composed of 300 characters for each author. All texts must be in English.
        You can upload a representative image of the proposal (optional). It is not necessary to enter
        any bibliographic references.</p>
      <p>In the following step of sending the full paper to be submitted to the review process,
        authors must upload a .docx file, laid out according to the full paper format. At this point, it
        will be also possible to update the authors&apos; list, the title, the abstract, and the keywords of
        the contribution.</p>
